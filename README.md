# calendar-app
Build a Calendar Slot Booking service, similar to that of Calendly, which allows people
to define their available slots on a day and other people to book them.

Requirements
This application can be built on any framework which you are comfortable with and feel is best
suited for this.
1. You would need to create the backend APIs for this application.
2. Create a basic user registration and authentication system.
3. Create APIs using which a user can define their available slots for a particular day.
Assume that each slot is a fixed hourly slot. For example, 12:00-13:00, 13:00-14:00, etc.
4. Create APIs using which a user can book an available slot.
5. Show an error response when an unauthenticated user is trying to access the APIs.
Bonus Points

● Should be able to integrate with Google Calendar
● Unit tests
Assignment Submission
● Deploy this application on any cloud provider Heroku, Zeit, Runkit, etc. Send us the link
to test the application along with a Postman collection documenting all exposed
endpoints.
● Upload the source code on Github for us to review. Make sure you follow all the best
practices while using git as you would do on any production application. Git history is
also important here.

Focus on getting the entire flow working - edge cases/bonus items are less important.
We are mainly trying to understand how you would architect it, the best practices you follow,
and any foresight you display while making design decisions. So please keep a note of these as
you proceed with this exercise.
